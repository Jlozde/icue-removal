# Corsair iCUE Uninstaller Script

**Because I've had enough.**

This batch script exists because iCUE simply refuses to uninstall properly without me tearing my hair out every six months. So, here we are.

If you've also suffered through this endless cycle of uninstalling hell, this script is my gift to youâ€”a public service for all of us trapped in Corsair's software nightmare.

## How to use:
1. Download the `.bat` file.
2. Right-click and run it as **Administrator**.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to fully remove Corsair iCUE.
4. Enjoy your newfound freedom.

You're welcome.
